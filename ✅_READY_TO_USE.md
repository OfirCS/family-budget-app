## 🚀 What You Need to Do (3 Minutes)

### FINAL STEP: Connect the Tunnel

The bot server is running but Twilio can't reach it yet because it's on your computer. You need to create a public tunnel with ngrok.

**Option A: Easiest (Desktop App)**
1. Download ngrok: https://ngrok.com/download
2. Extract and run `ngrok.exe`
3. Type: `ngrok http 3002`
4. Copy the URL (looks like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

**Option B: Command Line**
```bash
# Install ngrok globally (if not done)
npm install -g ngrok

# Start tunnel
ngrok http 3002
```

### Then: Update Twilio Webhook

1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com
2. **Messaging** → **Settings** → **WhatsApp Sandbox Settings**
3. In **Webhook URL** field, paste:
   ```
   https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/whatsapp
   ```
   *(Replace `your-ngrok-url` with your actual ngrok URL)*
4. Click **Save**

### That's it! 🎉

Your WhatsApp bot is now live!

## 📱 Test It Immediately

💡 Try: "budget", "summary", "help"
```

## 🔑 Important Reminders

⚠️ **ngrok URL Changes**
- Every time you restart ngrok, you get a new URL
- You need to update Twilio webhook with new URL
- Keep ngrok running while using the bot

⚠️ **Keep Bot Running**
```bash
# Keep this terminal open:
npm run bot

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### "Bot not responding"
- Make sure `npm run bot` is running
- Check ngrok URL is correct in Twilio
- Verify Twilio credentials in `.env`

### "ngrok URL keeps changing"
- This is normal! Each restart generates new URL
- Just update Twilio webhook with new URL
- Keep ngrok running once you find a working URL

### "Twilio says webhook URL is invalid"
- Make sure you add `/whatsapp` to end of ngrok URL
- Example: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/whatsapp`
- Not: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`

### "Messages not being processed"
- Check bot server logs for errors
- Verify ngrok tunnel is active
- Try sending a test message: "help"
