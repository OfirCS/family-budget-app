## üéì Which Should You Use?

**I recommend: localhost.run**

Why?
- ‚úÖ Takes 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ No installation
- ‚úÖ Works instantly
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing
- ‚úÖ Just 1 command!

**After you confirm it works, consider Railway for permanent setup.**

## üÜò Issues?

### "SSH command not found"
- You have Windows 7/8 (get ngrok or use Railway)

### "Connection refused"
- Make sure `npm run bot` is running in first terminal
- Check port 3002 is not blocked

### "localhost.run URL doesn't work"
- You need to update Twilio webhook
- Copy exact URL from localhost.run output

---

## ‚ö° Super Quick Summary

**To get working in 2 minutes:**

```bash
# Terminal 1:
npm run bot

# Terminal 2:
ssh -R 80:localhost:3002 localhost.run

# Copy URL from Terminal 2
# Paste URL + /whatsapp into Twilio

# Test by texting bot!
```

That's literally it! üéâ
